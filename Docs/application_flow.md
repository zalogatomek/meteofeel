# MeteoFeel - Application Flow

## User Onboarding Flow

### 1. Profile Creation
1. User enters basic information (name)
2. User selects their location
   - Can search for location
   - Can use current location
   - Can manually enter coordinates
3. User selects health issues to monitor
   - Presented with list of available health issues
   - Can select multiple issues
   - Can add/remove issues later

### 2. Initial Data Collection
1. System fetches weather data for user's location
   - Three forecasts per day (morning/afternoon/evening)
2. System prepares for daily health status tracking

## Daily Application Flow

### 1. Weather Data Collection
1. System fetches weather data three times per day
   - Morning forecast
   - Afternoon forecast
   - Evening forecast
2. System stores weather data for analysis

### 2. Health Status Tracking
1. User logs daily health status once per day
   - Reports overall well-being
   - Indicates which health issues occurred
   - Specifies time periods when issues occurred (morning/afternoon/evening)
2. System creates health record
   - Combines daily health status with all three weather forecasts
   - Stores for historical analysis
   - Used for pattern recognition

### 3. Alert System
1. System maintains health patterns for each user's health issues
   - Weather parameters to monitor
   - Conditions to check
   - Threshold values
   - Risk levels
2. When new weather data arrives
   - System checks each health pattern
   - Compares current weather values with pattern conditions
   - Evaluates risk of health issues occurring
3. If pattern conditions are met
   - System creates health alert
   - Includes current weather value
   - Links to specific health issue
4. User receives and responds to alerts

## Data Flow

### Weather Data
1. External weather service API calls
2. Data parsing and validation
3. Local storage
4. Pattern matching and alert generation

### Health Data
1. User input collection
2. Data validation
3. Local storage
4. Historical record creation
5. Correlation with weather data

## Technical Considerations

### Weather Data
- API rate limits
- Data refresh frequency (3 times per day)
- Error handling
- Offline capabilities

### Health Data
- Data privacy
- Local storage
- Data synchronization
- Backup and recovery

### Alerts
- Pattern matching efficiency
- Risk level evaluation
- Alert delivery
- Alert history
